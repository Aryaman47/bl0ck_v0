# Project Setup (Windows)
Make sure that Python (>=3.10) is installed in the system. Otherwise install it and add it to path (environment variables). 
Create a virtual environment within the `path/to/bl0ck_v0`

    python -m venv venv_name

Enter the virtual environment using:

    venv_name/Scripts/activate


## Download Dependencies
The project uses fastAPI to make API requests and uvicorn to load the frontend in development environment, locally. Download fastAPI using:

    pip install fastapi uvicorn


## Project Launch
Once the virtual environment has been activated, executed the following commands in powershell terminal of VS Code:
    
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload

Open new terminal and execute the following: (Optional but Recommended)
   
    . ./profile-curl.ps1

Follow the list of API calls mentioned below
---

> **_NOTE_** *Execute `. ./profile-curl.ps1` to use `cl` and `clPost` to avoid using `curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and `curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, respectively. Change the port number in profile-curl.ps1, in case the default is busy.*
