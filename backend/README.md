# Project Setup (Windows)
Make sure that Python (>=3.10) is installed in the system. Otherwise install it and add it to path (environment variables). 
Create a virtual environment within the `path/to/bl0ck_v0`

    python -m venv venv_name

Enter the virtual environment using:

    venv_name/Scripts/activate


## Download Dependencies
The project uses fastAPI to make API requests and uvicorn to load the frontend in development environment, locally. Download fastAPI using:

    pip install fastapi uvicorn


## Project Launch
Once the virtual environment has been activated, execute the following commands in powershell terminal in VS Code:
    
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload

Open new terminal and execute the following: (Optional but Recommended)
   
    . ./profile-curl.ps1

Follow the list of API calls mentioned below

## API calls via Powershell Terminal using curl.exe
---

> **_NOTE_** *Execute `. ./profile-curl.ps1` to use `cl` and `clPost` in order to avoid using `curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and `curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, respectively. Change the port number in profile-curl.ps1, in case the default is busy.*

# Project Setup (Linux / Ubuntu)

Make sure that Python (>=3.10) is installed in the system. Otherwise install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
````

Create a virtual environment within the `path/to/bl0ck_v0`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv_name
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv_name/bin/activate
```

---

## Download Dependencies

The project uses **FastAPI** to make API requests and **Uvicorn** to load the frontend in development environment, locally.

Install them:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

---

## Project Launch

Once the virtual environment has been activated, execute the following:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

(Optional but Recommended) – In a new terminal, enable the `cl` shortcut to avoid typing long curl commands.

Add the `cl` script to your system once:

```bash
sudo cp cl /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cl
```

Now you can use the `cl` command globally.

---

## API calls via Terminal using `curl`

---

> ***NOTE***
> The `cl` command is a helper wrapper for `curl` defined in the repo (`scripts/cl`).
> If installed as shown above, you can use `cl blockchain ...` instead of typing `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/...`.
> For `POST` requests, simply use `cl ...` (no separate `clPost` needed).
> Change the port number in the script if 8000 is already in use.
